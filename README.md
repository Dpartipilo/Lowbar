# Lowbar 

Lowbar is my own replica of the JS library "_underscore", in order to understand how a JS library works i'll be reimplementing the functionality of every _underscore function.


## Core

These are the core functions I will aim to get finished;

1. identity
2. first
3. last
4. each
5. indexOf
6. filter
7. reject
8. uniq
9. map
10. contains

## Advanced

These are a little harder but will be very beneficial to try and complete.

1. pluck
2. reduce
3. every
4. some
5. extends
6. defaults
